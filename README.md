## 🪷 Features

- Module independent, content configured via `config` file.
- Chinese Support.
- Brief PDF structure, easy to find.

## 📦 Requirements

- Tex-Live
- g++ compiler (Theoretically any C++ compiler will work, but it's untested.)
- make

## 🧭 Usage

### 1.Install dependences:

**For Arch linux:**
```bash
sudo pacman -S make g++
yay -S texlive-full
```

**For Ubuntu:**
```bash
sudo apt-get install texlive-full
sudo apt-get install build-essential
```

**For other distributions:**

Refer to the documentation for each distribution.

After the installation is complete, enter the following code to check if the installation was successful.
```bash
make --version
g++ --version
latex --version
```

If successful, you should see output similar to the following.
```bash

### 2.Clone

Use `git clone` to clone the project locally.
```bash
git clone git@github.com:GEJXD/Algo-template.git.
cd Algo-templatee
```

### 3.Edit your template

You can change the author, title, etc. attributes of `head.tex`.

The `config` file in the root directory of this project is a configuration file for a first-level directory, mainly used to control the output of Section. The internal name represents a first-level directory. The name needs to be changed by the user. **Note that the subfolder name should same as the `config` file.**

The config in each first-level subfolder is used to configure the output of the subsection and whether or not there is a subsubsection. Format are as follow:

- `<subsection name> <code file> <tex file> <subsubsection name>`
- subsection name: fill in the name of the desired Subsection inside the <>.
- code file: The code file corresponding to the current subsection.
- tex file: The description file corresponding to the current subsection
- If you need a subsubsection, then you only need to fill in the subsection with the same name as <subsubsection name>. **Note that the second and third parameters need to be left blank at this point. see `Math/config` and `Math/RandomTheory/config`.** 
- The configuration of the config file in the subsubsection is the same as above. **Note that there are no support for subsubsubsection :(.**

### 4.Compile

just run the command `make` at the root directory of the project.

after that you will see a lot of log output. If you see output similar to the following:
```bash
Output written on template.pdf (42 pages).
Transcript written on template.log.
```

the `template.pdf` are the result.
you can run the `make clean` command to clean.
